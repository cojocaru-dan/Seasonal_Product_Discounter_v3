# Seasonal-Product-Discounter-3

### On this week, we are going the further enhance our Seasonal Product Updater. The main focus this time will be on the user interfaces that provide user level access to different functionalities of the application. Through the excercise we are going to get familiar with two new concepts: design patterns, and within those the Factory Pattern; and a new SOLID principle, the Liskov Substitution Principle.

### Our current aim is to have three different user interfaces available in the application: one for browsing products, one for product statistics; and a third one for displaying the currently available offers (products with discounts). After running the application, the user should be able to choose which screen they would like to see. Also, some screens will require the user to be authenticated.

### What are we going to learn?
### •	Abstract classes
### •	Inheritance
### •	The Factory method design pattern
### •	The Liskov Substitution Principle
